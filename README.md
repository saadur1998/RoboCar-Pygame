Fun and experimentation with the pygame library.

## About
This repository contains code related to creating a simple car game using pygame. It’s a fun project where you can explore game development concepts and create your own car navigation system.

## Repository Contents

### PyGame Car Keyboard Control.py
This script is designed to control a car in a game using keyboard inputs. It likely includes event handling for key presses and releases to move the car in different directions. The car’s movement might be updated based on the state of these keys.

### PyGame Car Object Navigation.py
This script demonstrates object navigation within the game. It might involve moving the car around obstacles or towards certain objectives. The car’s movement could be determined by some algorithm or logic that takes into account the positions of various objects in the game.
